Web Scraper for Google News Top 10 Headlines Using Selenium
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop an automated web scraper using Selenium that fetches the top 10 news headlines from Google News. This tool can be useful for individuals who want to quickly access the latest news without manually browsing through the website. The project will involve setting up a Selenium environment, navigating to Google News, extracting the headlines, and optionally saving the results to a file or database.

Project Objectives:
Automate Google News Access: Use Selenium to open a web browser and navigate to the Google News homepage.
Scrape Top 10 Headlines: Extract the text of the top 10 news headlines from the page.
Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database).
Scheduling (Optional): Set up a scheduler (e.g., using cron jobs) to run the scraper at regular intervals and update the news headlines.
